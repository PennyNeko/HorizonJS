# HorizonJS
A simple small js framework made to help me right more structured, readable code

## What it is:
Horizon is not ment to compete with other javascript major frameworks, like Angular, React etc, at least at this point. 

It is  a small project created purely for  author's fun and to explore some of the new ES6 features like promises, fetch API, template strings, fat arrow functions etc... The main idea is to try to seperate code and logic into 
distinctive, objects that should be readable, maintable and reusable. 

There is also an in-built custom templating system built upon es6
template-strings. 

As you can expect this small framework targets modern browsers that utilize es6 new features. It goes without saying that it will not work 
on Internet Explorer (we should help to get rid off IE)  

More info, code commenting / documentation, and examples will come in the next few days.
